# Getting Started with AI-T

AI-T is an innovative web-based NFT metaverse game, meticulously built with Three.js, that merges the excitement of blockchain gaming with cutting-edge AI technologies on the Starknet platform. Featuring advanced AI capabilities, including GPT-like responses, AI-T offers a richly immersive gaming experience. Players engage in various activities like collecting and trading, street battles, PvE, PvP, and syndicate events such as wars.

Game Narrative: In AI-T, players are transported to MetaWar, a world in turmoil where three factions are embroiled in conflict over resources, grudges, and ideology:

Super Empire: A wealthy nation fixated on body modification, faith, and purity.
Econo: A hyper-industrial republic run by gleeful, brutish engineers who always keep their word.
Peace: A massive tree reaching into the heavens, home to a peace-loving society of naturalists.
The Sundering scattered powerful gems known as cyberstones across Eld, unleashing corrupt beings from the Abyss. Forced to retreat to their capitals, the factions united to face this existential threat. This alliance led to the creation of CyberPersons, powerful robot units powered by cyberstones, forming the last line of defense against the Abyss, commanded by remote expert Pilots in teams of four.

AI and Blockchain Integration: AI-T not only entertains but also serves as a learning platform, emphasizing the integration of AI and blockchain. Players will experience GPT-like AI interactions and responses, making the game environment highly dynamic and intelligent. By utilizing Cairo, a high-level language that compiles into provable programs, participants will embark on various Cairo Quests, such as Thinking in Cairo, Sparring Sorcerers, and Puzzling Pyramids, to master the tools required for building AI-enabled dApps.

Track Challenges: Participants are encouraged to delve into the intersections between AI and blockchain through challenges like:

Developing machine learning models to analyze blockchain data.
Designing AI solutions to detect Sybil attacks in airdrops.
Creating models to identify vulnerabilities in smart contracts.
Leveraging blockchain data to train specialized AI agents.
Building development-support tools for the Starknet ecosystem.
Innovating with real-world applications, unique integrations, and creative use cases.
